# sfWidgetWordCounter plugin (for Symfony 1.3, 1.4)

The `sfWidgetWordCounterPlugin` is a Symfony widget that adds a
jQuery word counter to a form field. This is a jQuery word counter
that counts the words in a given input field and displays the
counter in a html tag.

# Features

The features of the counter are:

-   A word limit can be supplied. This makes the counter count down
    from the limit

-   A custom message can be displayed when this word limit is
    breached

    breached.
